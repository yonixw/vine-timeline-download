# vine-timeline-download
Download all vines in your timeline (include revines)

How: clone repo, change timeline url in VineJSONDownload.cs (like in line 136).
Change settings. Get vine session id from headers when going into browser (like tih F12 in chrome)

Start and download all files!

(Vine decided to close on 17.01.17 so this is a day late solution. Sorry for being late.)
